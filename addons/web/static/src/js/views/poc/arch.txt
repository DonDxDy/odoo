View is just a renaming of the Renderer legacy

ViewController is the unification of the View legacy and the Controller
it serves to create the configuration of Model (+ load params), View,
ControlPanel and SearchPanel.

?. Drop MVC pattern?
   View could have a hook to use models as we have components and not
   widgets anymore.

?. ViewController shouldn't have any logic/behaviour, just configuration of sub
   components.
